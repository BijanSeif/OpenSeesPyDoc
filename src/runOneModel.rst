=======================
 Run one model button
=======================

- This button is at the top of
  the cloud viewer, next to the :doc:`runAllModel`.

- This button will run the currently focused
  model.

- The name of the currently focused model will be
  displayed on the button.

- To make a model currently focused, you
  can open the model's module and click
  in the editor.

- Once a model is run, all other models are kept except
  those are changed in the current model.
